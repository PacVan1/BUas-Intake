BUas intake project by Ayser Hartgring

My application is for the Game Programming. My program is written in C++. I used a single library, which specifically was a graphics library called SFML. Which was suggested in the assignment. Except for that library everything is handwritten by me. This was also my first time writting a program in C++, where in the past I would use C# (Unity), Java (Processing) or GML (GameMaker Studio) to write my programs. For some pieces code I needed help of the internet, so I left some of the sources I used down below. This project took me around 50 +/- to make. I am currently a first year HKU Game Development study, but I decided to switch studies, which I will explain later why. 

My game works as follows: 
You're a spaceship harvesting minerals from big meteorites. The goal is to *collect* as much minerals before your health is depleted. You lose health whenever you get hit by a meteorite. You gain minerals whenever you destroy a meteorite using your own projectiles. You can move around using the WASD keyboard keys (W = forward, A = left, S = downward, D = right). You can fire projectiles using your left mouse button. Therefor aiming is done using your mouse position (mouse suggested). Thanks in advanced for playing my game. I worked hard to get it finished. I hopefully see you later at the next stage of the BUas intake.
